# Sea Match 🕹️

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

## Getting Started

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. 🎉
